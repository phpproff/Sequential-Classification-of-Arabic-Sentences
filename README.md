# Sequential-Classification-of-Arabic-Sentences
Hybrid Deep Learning Models for Sequential Classification of Arabic Sentences
----------------------------------
# Intro:
In this Repo., we release the implementation of eight deep learning models for sequential classification 
of Arabic sentences, including two new hybrid architectures ( marked with * ) that introduce sequence position and order. 
In this work, we experimented with eight different model architectures. These models will also use different 
set of features. These eight models are:
• Model 1: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based Model 
• Model 2: Bi-directional Long Short-term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) based Model
• Model 3: Bi-LSTM with FastText Word Embeddings Model
• Model 4: Bi-LSTM with Character Embeddings Model
• Model 5: Bi-LSTM with Word and Character Embeddings combined Model
• (*) Model 6: Bi-LSTM with FastText Word embeddings and Positional Embeddings 
• (*) Model 7: Bi-LSTM + Character embeddings + FastText Word Embeddings + Positional 
Embeddings Model. 
• Model 8: AraBERT Model for Arabic Text Classification Using Contextualized Word 
Embeddings
